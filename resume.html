						<h2>Objective</h2>
						<p class="a">After multiple years in support, 
						and completing multiple industry certificates plus 2 graduate certificates. 
						I believe my future is in programming since the high grades I received are in Technology base subjects. 
						Additionally, I have currently completed 20 subjects in Computer Science, soon to be 23 after this month. 
						I believe that my future company will be in the IT sector since all my previous challenges were in non-IT sectors
						
						<h2>Experience</h2>
						<h4>Service Desk Analyst</h4>
						<h5>Thermo Fisher / Scoresby / 2019 – Jun 2020</h5>
						<p class="a">
						As an analyst, my role required me to identify any weakness in the current Service Desk and 
						then provide a report with an alternative solution. i.e. improve the current process and 
						procedures and analyse the data to identify any areas which require attention.
						During my time there, the Team completed a tech refresh for over ~300 staff members 
						at the Scoresby site, which included desktops and laptops, without disrupting the current 
						support service, which included over 500 staff members within Australia. From April 2019, 
						the tickets were around 300 a month; by mid-2020, our Team reduced the Tickets to 200 a month.
						<h4>Level 2 Support Engineer</h4>
						<h5>Jasco / Doncaster / 2016 – 2018</h5>
						<p class="a">
						While working for an MSP (Managed Service Provider), the daily task involved answering calls 
						and creating tickets. It was prevalent for us to collaborate with the Senior Engineers. 
						Other jobs were running power shell scripts, which provided data such as permissions for each shared folder. 
						One of the advantages while working for Jasco was learning the Skype/Lync administration software. 
						An essential part of my job was prioritising, supporting VIP and ensuring the network run optimally.
						ITIL was a part of Jasco, which required a change request before reconfiguring the infrastructure.
						We would monitor the resources and backups and ensure the servers were running by receiving 
						notifications from the central board. 
						When the staff could not resolve laptops and computers during a remote session, 
						we would get the computers delivered and then perform a re-imaging process via SCCM.
						Onboarding new users and changing existing users to ensure they have access to all the delegated 
						resources was ordinary. If required, we would create technical documentation processes. Our roster was 7 am to 7 pm on a rotating schedule.
						<h4>Service Desk Analyst</h4>
						<h5>Emergency Services Telecommunication Authority / Burwood / 2015 - 2016</h5>
						<p class="a">
						The Team was responsible for improving the current Distribution List and the Active Directory. 
						The Service documentation had to be up to date. Our project was providing new Tech equipment to all three sites, 
						including Ballarat, Burwood East, and the Docklands.
